    % Given two spike trains, this function calculates the coincidence of spikes between them.
    % Uses a greedy matching algorithm to pair spikes based on minimum distance.
    % Returns C: coincidence array (1 if matched and within tau, 0 otherwise)
    %        spike_times: corresponding spike times for each coincidence value
